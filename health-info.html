            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial for overall health. Aim to consume a variety of foods to ensure you're getting a range of nutrients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Include a mix of colorful vegetables to get essential vitamins and minerals. Leafy greens like spinach and kale are particularly beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Choose fruits with high fiber content, such as apples, berries, and citrus fruits. These can help with digestion and provide antioxidants.</li>
                <li><strong>Lean Proteins:</strong> Opt for lean meats like chicken, turkey, and fish. Plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils, and tofu are also great options.</li>
                <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Incorporate whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread into your diet. They provide more nutrients and fiber compared to refined grains.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Limit intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt.</p>

            <h2>Exercise</h2>
            <p>Regular physical activity is key to maintaining a healthy body and mind. The benefits of exercise include improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mood, and better sleep quality. Here are some recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aerobic Exercise:</strong> Activities like walking, running, cycling, and swimming increase heart rate and improve lung capacity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Incorporate exercises that build muscle strength, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats). Aim for two or more days a week of strength training exercises.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and Balance:</strong> Practices like yoga or stretching can improve flexibility and balance, which is important for overall mobility and injury prevention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember to start slowly if you're new to exercise and gradually increase intensity. Consult a fitness professional or healthcare provider for a personalized exercise plan.</p>
